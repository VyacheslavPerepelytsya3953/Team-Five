Blind operator add-on

**Description**

A smart add-on device that is used to wirelessly operate corded blinds. 
It will use a dc motor, light sensor, distance sensor, and temperature sensor in order to control and operate blinds wirelessly. 

The device is a basically a box that connects to most blinds operation controls that contains a motor that will control the opening and closing of the blinds, a temperature sensor to monitor the room so if the room gets too hot then the blinds will automatically close in order to cool the room, the temperature will be set by the user using the app. The next sensor is the light sensor, this will monitor the light in the room and if the room gets too bright then it will automatically close the blind, (records data to learn how bright the user wants the room). And the final sensor is a distance sensor to calibrate the device.
